# pairing-in-go-intro

## Mission
We as a pairing group (ensemble), need to write a function that takes an integer as an argument
and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

## Example
```
2 -> "Even"
-1 -> "Odd"
```

## TDD Approach
1. Write a test (describing an aspect of the program)
2. Run the test (which should fail because the program lacks that feature)
3. Write just enough code (the simplest possible) to make the test pass
4. Refactor the code and run the test until it conforms to our mission goal
5. Repeat!

## Roles
- Driver: the one on the keyboard who shares their screen
- Navigator: all the rest of persons in our group

## Driver Switching
The driver is allowed only to write one line of code, then they hand over to the next person!
